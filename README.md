## Hello chat
Im Kriden or as few people previously knew me as FireOfGaiming (yes the spelling is wrong, i was very young when I chose it).

Im from Latvia and have a big interest in tech and do a bit of programming.
im currently studying to be a computer system technician (i hope the name translates well) and plan to learn programming as a side project.
